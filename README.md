=================

An example application demonstrating the '_emerge_' programming idea.

This calculator allows the user to type and in real-time, the result 'emerges' pretty much from first principles.

_emerge_ is a way of writing code based around cause and effect. Small (tiny!) blocks of code define things or 'effects' which are dependent on causes.
